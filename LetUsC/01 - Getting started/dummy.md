# Types of C constants
## C constants can be divided into two major categories:
(a) - Primary Constants
(b) - Secondary Constants

### Primary constants:
* Integer Constant
* Real Constants
* Character Constant

### Secondary constants:
* Array
* Pointer
* Union
* Enum. etc.

# Rules for Constructing Integer Constants:
(a) - An integer constant must have at least one digit.
(b) - It must not have a decimal point.
(c) - It can be either positive or negative.
(d) - If no sigh preceds an integer constant it is assumed to be positive.
(e) - No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.
(f) - The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to 32767.

# Rules for Constructing Real Constants:
_Real constants are often called Floating Point Constants. The real constants could be written in two forms-- Fractional form and Exponential form._


(a) - An integer constant must have at least one digit.
(b) - It must not have a decimal point.
(c) - It can be either positive or negative.
(d) - If no sigh preceds an integer constant it is assumed to be positive.
(e) - No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.
(f) - The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to 32767.
