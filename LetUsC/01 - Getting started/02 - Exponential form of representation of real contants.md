# The exponential for of representation:
1. _This form of representation is usually used if the value of the constant is either too small or too large. However, we could use this type of notation to represent whatever other real constants._

2. _In exponential form of representation, the real constant is represented in two parts. The part appearing before 'e' is called mantissa, whereas the part following 'e' is called exponent._

(a) - The mantissa part and the exponential part should be separeted by a letter e.

(b) - The mantissa part may have a positive or negative sign.

(c) - Default sign of mantissa part is positive.

(d) - The exponent must have at least one digit, which must be a positive or negative integer. Default sign positive.

(e) - Range of real constants expressed in exponential for is -3.4e38 to 3.4e38.
