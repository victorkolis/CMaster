# Types of C constants
## C constants can be divided into two major categories:
(a) - Primary Constants

(b) - Secondary Constants

### Primary constants:
* Integer Constant
* Real Constants
* Character Constant

### Secondary constants:
* Array
* Pointer
* Union
* Enum. etc.

# Rules for Constructing Integer Constants:
(a) - An integer constant must have at least one digit.

(b) - It must not have a decimal point.

(c) - It can be either positive or negative.

(d) - If no sigh preceds an integer constant it is assumed to be positive.

(e) - No commas or blanks are allowed within an integer constant.

(f) - The allowable range for integer constants is -32768 to 32767.

# Rules for Constructing Real Constants:
_Real constants are often called Floating Point Constants. The real constants could be written in two forms-- Fractional form and Exponential form._


(a) - *A real constant must have at least one digit.*

(b) - It must have a decimal point.

(c) - It could be either positive or negative.

(d) - Default sign is positive.

(e) - No commas or blanks are allowed within a real constant.

# Rules for Constructing Character Constants:
(a) - A character constant is a single alphabet, a single digit or
a single special symbol enclosed within single inverted commas. Both the inverted commas should point to the left. For example, [`A`] is a valid character constant whereas ['A'] is not.

(b) - The maximum length of a character constant can be 1 character.
